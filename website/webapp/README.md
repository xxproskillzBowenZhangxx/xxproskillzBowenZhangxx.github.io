# Web App Project

## Introduction

You've now learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Congratulations!

In this project you will use all that you know to put together a project of your own design. Take a look at some of the demos if you need some inspiration, but use your imagination and make this project your own!! It could be anything!

You will work in a group of 3-4 students over the course of 8 weeks to bring your project to life. You will use a technique called "Agile Programming" (more on that below) as you work together and you will collaborate using GitHub to maintain and combine your individual contributions.

## Timeline

This project will take 8 weeks. I will grade your progress at the end of each week. Halfway through I expect a "working" product. It might not do everything you want, but it should perform the most basic goal of your project. From that point on, your job is to add features and refinements to it.

## Requirements

### STRUCTURE (index.html)

All of your HTML goes here. Do not include any additional HTML files.

### FORM (webapp.css)

All style information goes here. Do not include any additional CSS files. Your web app needs to be responsive.

### LOGIC (webapp.js)

All of your javascript goes here. You may use jQuery also, if you wish.

## Tips

1. **Don't bite off more than you can chew!**
2. **Focus on your strengths!** If your group feels very creative and strong with HTML/CSS then focus on that... but it had better be original and look amazing! (And of course, you still need to use *some* JavaScript)
3. **Browse the web for ideas**, but don't use someone else's code if you can't understand it, and *customize it to your own needs.*
4. **Divide and conquer!** Teams work best when each member is given a task to solve (Scrum Master, this is your job). If you've got a *really* difficult task, maybe have everyone come up with their own solution and see whose solution is best!

## Agile (or "Scrum") Programming

### Overview
Work is broken down into manageable, bite-sized chunks called **Sprints**. Each Sprint is one week long with the goal of producing a  **Potentially Shippable Product** with an incremental improvement upon the previous week.

### Definitions

#### Roles

- **Product Owner (Mr. Scheuerlein)**
- **Scrum Master (rotation each week)**: *Think of this role like an administrator. You won't write much code this week, but you will be responsible for organizing your team.*
  - Lead the meetings:
    - Beginning of the period: What will we do today?
    - End of the period: How did we do today?
    - End of each Sprint: Meet with the Product Owner to discuss progress.
  - Determine which project everyone should be working on. Monitor their progress and assist as needed.
  - Approve/disapprove all Pull Requests.
  - Submit and assign bugs.
- **Team (everyone else)**

#### Artifacts

- **Product Backlog**: *All the features you want in your final product.*
- **User Stories**: *Features described as a story from the user's perspective: "I want... so that..."*
- **Sprint Backlog**: *The User Stories which you intend to complete this Sprint.*

#### Ceremonies

- **Sprint Planning**: *This is done at the beginning of each week. The Scrum Master meets with the Product Owner to plan this week's Sprint Backlog.*
- **Daily Scrum**: *A brief meeting at the beginning of each class period. "What will we do today?"*
- **Sprint Review**: *This is done at the end of each week. Demonstrate your product to the Product Owner and discuss what could be done better.*

#### Potentially Shippable Product

The idea here is that someone could download your web app and use it as is. Think of an iPad app you use: it hasn't always had all of the features that it does, but when it was first released it was "complete". Today's newer version is also "complete", they've just added features and fixed bugs over time. It's a process, but if it isn't ready, then it isn't potentially shippable.

## Grading

### Sprint Notes (10 points each / 80 points total / 51% of the overall project)

At the end of each week, Scrum Masters will meet with me for review. The entire group will receive this grade.

### Halfway Point (25 points / 16% of the overall project)

At this point in the project your web app should be a **potentially shippable product** (see definitions above). I will download your web app and grade it according to the included final product's rubric (but cut in half). I will determine if it is ready to merge into the master branch ("release day"). If it is ready then we will merge it with the master branch.

### Final Product (50 points / 32% of the overall project)

I will be grading the final product according to the included rubric.
